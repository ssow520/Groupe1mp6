# Project Documentation Overview

This repository contains the core documentation used to structure and guide the software project throughout its lifecycle.


## Documents Included

### 1. `SRS.md` — Software Requirements Specification
This document describes **what the system must do**.  
It defines:
- the project scope (included and excluded features),
- functional requirements,
- non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, etc.),
- constraints (platform, tools, deadlines),
- assumptions and dependencies.

The SRS serves as the **reference for understanding the system requirements** and as the foundation for design and development decisions.

---

### 2. `ADR.md` — Architecture Decision Records
This document records **why key architectural and technical decisions were made**.

Each ADR captures:
- the context of the decision,
- the selected solution,
- alternatives considered,
- justifications,
- consequences and trade-offs.

ADR entries ensure **traceability, consistency, and clarity** throughout the evolution of the system architecture.

---

## How These Documents Are Used Together

- The **SRS** defines *what* the system should be.
- The **ADR** explains *how and why* architectural decisions are taken to meet those requirements.

Together, they provide a clear, professional, and maintainable documentation framework aligned with modern software engineering practices.
